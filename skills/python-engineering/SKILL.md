# Python Engineering

Use this Skill for Python-specific engineering review, convention design, and analysis.

## Entry Conditions

Activate this Skill when the task is Python-specific engineering: project shape or package layout, Python version policy, dependency management, type hints and checking strategy, testing, docstrings, custom lint, grammar choices, standard-library mechanisms, or toolchain setup.

## Mode Selection

Three modes are available. Default to fast review.

|Mode|Trigger|Read|
|-|-|-|
|Fast review|Default for daily self-check, small diff, PR review|`./workflow/fast-review.md`|
|Full review|User explicitly says "full review", "complete review", "systematic review"|`./workflow/full-review.md`|
|Analysis|User asks for discussion, brainstorm, design comparison, mechanism analysis, refactoring plan|`./workflow/analysis.md`|

Read-only constraint: when the user says "do not modify", "read-only", "just analyze", or "survey", do not run any command that writes files. Prefer `rg`, `git ls-files`, `git show`, `find`, `wc`, `nl`. Avoid `uv run`, `pytest`, `ruff check --fix`, `pre-commit run`, or any command that creates `.venv`, cache, or modifies source.

## Judgment Order

Route to leaf documents by signal. Read only what the task requires.

When terminology is unclear or inconsistent, read the [glossary](./glossary.md).

## Output Contract

Report findings first. Separate facts, inferences, judgments, and recommendations. Do not repeat issues that a formatter, linter, or type checker can determine mechanically.

Output format is mode-specific. Follow the matching workflow document (`./workflow/fast-review.md`, `./workflow/full-review.md`, or `./workflow/analysis.md`). Analysis mode gives options and tradeoffs, not a findings list.

Write output in the language required by global, project, or user instructions; when none is specified, use the current conversation's language.

## Stop Rules

- Do not automatically run full review mode.
- Do not modify code unless the user asks for fixes.
- Do not run unsafe fixes, bulk suppressions, cross-file refactors, dependency changes, or lockfile-altering commands without explicit confirmation.
- Do not write file modifications during read-only or analysis tasks.
- Do not report issues that Ruff, ty, or pre-commit can catch mechanically. Note them once in Notes if relevant, then move on.

# API and Communication

Boundary judgment for inter-service communication: sync/async/streaming, internal/external, contract strength—and only then REST/gRPC/GraphQL/Webhook. Use for designing service boundaries, public APIs, and third-party integration.

## The communication style decides the coupling style

The same "order notifies inventory to deduct" can be a synchronous REST call, a synchronous gRPC call, a published event consumed asynchronously, a GraphQL on-demand query, or a Webhook callback. All work, but the coupling differs completely: synchronous calls give clear results, but the caller can be slowed or dragged to death by the callee; async events decouple, but results are not immediately known and consistency gets more complex; GraphQL gives client flexibility, but server-side governance and performance get harder; Webhooks fit external notification, but retry, signing, and idempotency are mandatory.

**Fix the interaction semantics first, then the protocol.** Do not start with "we will use gRPC"; first judge whether this path must know the result synchronously.

## First cut: synchronous or asynchronous

|Style|Fits|Cost|
|-|-|-|
|Synchronous request/response|The caller waits for the result on the spot, needs immediate validation, must learn of failure at once|Every hop stacks tail latency; any dependency's failure propagates down the chain|
|Async messaging/events|Completion may lag; peak shaving needed; one datum feeding multiple downstreams|State progression gets complex; idempotency, compensation, and backlog governance must be added|
|Streaming|Output while generating, real-time state refresh, long-task progress|Connection keepalive, backpressure, and resume-after-disconnect must be handled|

Rules of thumb: the user must know immediately whether to proceed → sync; only needs to know it was accepted → async; needs to see change continuously → streaming.

## Protocols each have their edge; they are not substitutes

|Style|Better for|Not for|
|-|-|-|
|REST|Public APIs, ordinary web/SaaS, easy debugging, universal ecosystem|High-frequency internal calls, strict typed-contract demands|
|gRPC|Internal service-to-service, low latency, high throughput, strong IDL|Direct browser access, public APIs|
|GraphQL|Multi-client aggregated queries, frequently changing fields, frontend needs flexible composition|Complex writes; teams weak in caching/permission/rate-limit governance|
|Webhook|Third-party event notification, payment callbacks, external integration|Core paths needing synchronous, strong results|
|MCP|Exposing tools, resources, and context to AI agents|Ordinary business service communication without agent semantics|

Public APIs favor understandable, stable, versionable; internal high-frequency calls favor strong contracts and performance; multi-client frontend aggregation considers GraphQL but demands governance capability; third-party callbacks must handle signing, idempotency, and replay attacks; agent tool interfaces must write permissions and human review into the protocol boundary.

## The contract matters more than the protocol

An API's biggest risk is not HTTP versus protobuf but an **unclear contract**: inputs and outputs (field meanings, required/optional, units, enums), error semantics (which are retryable? which are user errors? which are system errors?), idempotency (what happens replaying one request twice? where is the idempotency key?), versioning policy (how are fields added/deprecated? how long are old clients supported?), rate limits and quotas (who may call how much? what returns on excess?), security boundary (authentication, authorization, signing, audit).

Without contract governance, REST becomes messy URLs, GraphQL becomes arbitrary database exposure, and gRPC becomes a strongly typed ball of mud.

## Internal communication: do not let call chains grow unbounded

The most common microservice performance problem is not one slow service but call-chain fan-out: user request → A → B/C → D/E/F/G. Each extra hop adds network latency, timeout and retry-storm risk, dependency-failure propagation, and trace-debugging cost.

Internal APIs need three companions: **timeout budgets** (upstream 500ms does not mean giving every downstream 500ms); **retry discipline** (retry only idempotent requests, with backoff and jitter); **degradation strategy** (return partial results or fallbacks when non-critical dependencies fail).

## External APIs: stability beats elegance

A public API is a promise the moment it ships: backward compatibility (adding fields is usually safe; removing or changing meaning is dangerous); stable error codes (customers write logic against your error semantics); docs and examples (if external developers cannot understand it, elegance is worthless); signing and replay defense (especially payments, Webhooks, agent tool calls); audit and rate limiting (traceable when things break, containable when abused).

For platform products, the API is not an implementation detail—it is part of the product, and its versioning and compatibility policy is an architecture boundary.

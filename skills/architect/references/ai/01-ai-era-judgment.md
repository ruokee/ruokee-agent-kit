# AI-era Judgment

Two fundamental changes AI brings to the architect's work: implementation getting cheap (vibe coding) and LLM systems as a new species. This document is the overview, giving the judgment baseline of "what changed, what did not"; the concrete design constraints of LLM systems are in [AI system design](./02-ai-system-design.md).

## Two shifts happening at once

Shift A: AI changed "how we build". Natural language to code—implementation collapsed from a scarce craft into seconds of generation. Shift B: AI brought a new species of "what we build". The LLM itself became a core component of a class of systems: chat products, RAG knowledge bases, agent platforms, inference services.

The combined core claim: **implementation gets ever cheaper, judgment gets ever more valuable.** When AI produces running code in seconds, the moat is no longer "can write" but "can judge"—judging, before acting, what this system should look like, where it will die, and what is being traded for what.

## Vibe coding amplifies everything, including architectural errors

Simon Willison's distinction: not all AI-assisted coding is vibe coding—the term specifically means **accepting AI-produced code without review**. For toys and prototypes it is brilliant; pushed straight to production, it hands users an unread house to live in.

The dangerous mechanism is faster output without matching judgment and verification. Code can arrive faster, architectural mistakes can spread faster, and technical debt does not have to queue. After the demo works, ask what happens when an external call times out, whether a retry charges twice, whether a failed dependency has a fallback, whether a hotspot overloads a shard, and whether a web page can use prompt injection to command a tool. Inspect the generated design, code, and tests for actual omissions; "AI wrote it" is not a guilty verdict. Faster generation does not fill the gap between prototype and production. See [Reviewing AI output](./04-reviewing-ai-output.md) for review criteria.

The correct posture is not refusing vibe coding but using it with judgment: vibe freely on toys and prototypes—validating ideas as fast as possible without over-engineering; on production systems, vibe the draft and close with judgment, interrogating the AI output: is the data consistent across the system, what happens on failure, where does it die at scale, can it evolve, where are the security boundaries. Feed judgment to the AI: write architectural constraints and quality targets into memory files like `AGENTS.md`, turning judgment into guardrails the AI keeps respecting.

## Three new constraints of LLM systems

**Non-determinism.** Ask the same question twice, and sampling, model versions, or context changes can produce different wording with two valid answers. Comparing a summary word for word with a reference can label a good paraphrase a bug; refunding twice cannot be excused as "model randomness". Keep assertions for deterministic behavior and explicit invariants. Assess open-ended quality with representative inputs, expected points, and rule-based or model scoring. When the score drops, inspect which category suffered, the consequences, and whether the difference exceeds run variance before deciding on release. See [Evaluation-driven architecture](./05-evaluation-driven-architecture.md) for the method.

**Context engineering.** The LLM's context window is its working memory—finite and billed by the token. Fitting exactly enough information into a finite, expensive window is the core craft of LLM systems. In essence a new memory hierarchy: context window (most expensive, fastest) → retrieval RAG (fetch on demand) → long-term memory (persisted across sessions). Stuff too much and it gets expensive and "lost in the middle"; stuff too little and it answers without grounds.

**Cost/latency/quality triangle.** Strong models are high-quality but expensive and slow; weak models are fast and cheap but quality-discounted—always a position choice inside the triangle. Cost is a first-class citizen: every call burns tokens, and resident agents burn 24×7. The countermeasures: model routing (small models for simple tasks), caching, batching, budget caps.

## Agentic systems stack every traditional hard problem

Autonomous agent systems are not a new domain; they are a superposition of traditional distributed-system problems: the action loop needs step/cost/timeout caps against runaway burning (load shedding and circuit breaking); tool calls need idempotency, and multi-step tasks resemble a distributed Saga (consistency); long tasks run long, nodes fail, dead-or-alive is indistinguishable, and state must be recoverable (partial failure); multi-agent collaboration is distribution plus fan-out amplification; prompt injection is the top threat, tool permissions need minimizing and sandboxing (security); agents as virtual colleagues reshape team division (organization).

That is why Anthropic repeats that line: **if a deterministic workflow can solve it, do not reach for an autonomous agent.** The stronger the autonomy, the harder the hard problems stack. The soul of mature agent products lies entirely in fitting brakes onto unleashed autonomy—and the brakes' design principles are exactly traditional resilience, consistency, and security engineering.

## What has not changed

The thinking framework of requirements → constraints → quality attributes → tradeoffs still holds for LLM systems; the quality-attribute table merely gains rows for cost/latency/quality/evaluability. There is no best architecture, only the most fitting: long context or RAG, strong model or weak model, workflow or agent—all tradeoffs, no silver bullets. Ask why before how: AI can answer "how" in seconds, but "why this one, and at what cost" still has to be asked by a human.

AI commoditized implementation and pushed the scarcity of judgment to a historical high. A person who can naturally ask, of every technical choice, "why this one, what does it cost, where does it die" is not replaced in the vibe-coding era—they become more irreplaceable than ever.

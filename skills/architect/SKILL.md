# Architecture

Use this Skill for system-level architecture analysis, design, review, technology selection, and evolution. The model does the primary reasoning; the reference documents supply architecture knowledge, judgment rationale, common tradeoffs, and examples. They do not freeze architecture work into fixed steps.

## Scope

This Skill handles system-level judgment: system boundaries, data and state, quality attributes, failure, scale, and long-term change. It covers five kinds of work: analysis, design, review, selection, and evolution. Boundaries: single-module internal design, coding implementation, and code-level quality review are out of scope; defining product behavior and ranking priorities are out of scope. Both follow their own ordinary processes.

This Skill does not do concrete implementation. Project facts come from the current code and configuration; product behavior comes from product documentation; priority calls belong to the user. The Skill replaces none of these. When recording architecture decisions, follow the current project's recording convention.

## Reference Navigation

Choose documents by the signals of the current question and read only what is needed. Numbering is for directory navigation only; documents are not meant to be read in order.

## Evidence Requirements

- Distinguish project facts, assumptions, suggestions, and user decisions, and label each category explicitly in output.
- Base judgments on the current project's code, configuration, and runtime evidence; the reference documents supply general judgment rationale, not project facts. Give project facts as `path:line`, config keys, command output, or observation windows.
- State uncertainty when evidence is missing; never pass generic assumptions off as project evidence.
- Company cases containing numerical claims, product-capability claims that affect decisions and may change across versions, and external research conclusions must cite a primary source with a publication date, product version, or access date. Stable category-level judgments and unverifiable rules of thumb do not need per-item citations; label the latter explicitly as heuristics and do not use them as upgrade triggers. Purely derived conclusions need no external citation.
- For derived conclusions (estimates, capacity reasoning, cost projections), show inputs, formulas, and uncertainty.
- Output distinguishes at least: observed (project evidence), derived from facts, unverified assumption, suggestion, and user decision.
- Citing upstream material marks the provenance of judgment rationale, not the decision itself.

## Output Contract

- Give candidate options with tradeoffs and applicability conditions for each, not a single answer; state the assumptions each judgment depends on.
- Translate technical tradeoffs into business consequences—cost, risk, and time; the user sets priorities.
- Analysis and design output centers on views and boundary descriptions; whether to proceed to implementation is the user's call.
